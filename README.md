# Tyche_Website

## This is a website for the `Tyche_Blockchain` project.
> if you want to know more about the project, you can visit the [Tyche_Blockchain](github.com/jestemAria/Tyche_Blockchain) repository.


It is based on JavaScript as the blockchain core and for blockchain backend. The frontend will be based on React but it is not deployed and created yet. The new ideas of Tyche Blockchain and Tyche Coin will be documented as fast as they deploy in the project. 
This website is a work in progress and will be updated as the project develops.
